# Flow partitioning device
Flow splitter for equine spirometry

The device distribute air flow into 4 branches having equal resistance. Hence the use of standard spirometry sensors for adults can be inserted in every branch and be used for horse spirometry. Measurement can be done on one sensor. Volume readings have to be multiplied by 4, Compliance readings have to be divided by 4.
